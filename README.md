## About the project üîç

This is a project I made for a blockchain college course, in which we had to
create a [Dapp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_application) with
the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) blockchain.

We had to create a system that justified the use of a decentralized
architecture. With this in mind, I thought that any sort of voting fits well
with it. Join this with my love for movies, you got yourself the **D'oscars**!

## Functionalities ü§ñ

It's pretty straightforward: you can register films and also vote for them. Each
of these actions cost _0.1 ether_. Other actions, such as changing the state of
the contract from _enlisting_ to _voting_ can only be done by the contract
owner.

## What I've learned üöÄ

I always try have to match things that I have to do with things that I'd like to
do. In this case, **I took the opportunity to improve my CSS skills and to
exercise my web design skills**.

I'd say that the experience was great. I learned some neat tricks with _image
loading_ and the overall look of the website was pretty good.

## Prints üèû

Here are some gifs showing how the project looks and works :)
