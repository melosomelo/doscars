_Decentralized movie voting system implemented with React and Solidity._

## About the project

This is a project I made for a blockchain college course, in which we had to
create a [Dapp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_application) with
the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) blockchain.

We had to create system that justified the use of a decentralized architecture.
With this in mind, I thought that any sort of voting app fits well with it. Join
this with my love for movies, you got yourself the **D'oscars**!
